                        <span class="initial">Generally,</span> there are two ways to get the news:
                        <ol>
                            <li>From talking to friends and acquaintances.</li>
                            <li>
                                From ad-supported organizations that understand that the best 
                                way to make money is to report lots of the most 
                                negative, emotion-stirring things (whether or 
                                not we really need to know them), as this best 
                                gets people's attention.
                            </li>

                        In response to this, some people have made the conscious 
                        choice to limit their exposure to news media. 
                        Some may even realize that the number of news events 
                        they really needed to know about annually could 
                        generally be counted on one hand.

                        For people who feel this way and don't want to be 
                        entirely reliant on their friends to learn about 
                        major events or how society is doing, there is the

                    <p>
                        This newspaper is delivered in the form of an email 
                        newsletter. Subscribers will get emails whenever something 
                        <a href="#threshold">truly newsworthy</a> happens, as 
                        well as a tri-annual short summary of what is going on 
                        in society in general. These summaries are no more than 
                        a few paragraphs.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Threshold</h2>
                    <p>
                        It is difficult to determine where to draw the line 
                        about what one needs to know to be minimally informed. 
                        I will be using the threshold that works best for me:
                        <blockquote>
                            Something is newsworthy if it would directly 
                            and substantially affect 
                            the life of someone living in the 
                            United States or Canada. This should happen fewer 
                            than five times per year.
                        </blockquote>
                        Obviously there are local events that could affect 
                        someone, but I'm thinking about a generic American or 
                        Canadian. People will need a different source of information 
                        for events that are only of local or specialized interest.

                        I do my best both to make sure that I send any newsworthy 
                        information and that the information I provide is accurate.
                        That being said, I could make a mistake. If you use this 
                        service you agree not sue me for any

                    <p>
                        Also, I may use third-party services (e.g. PayPal) to process 
                        payments and send out the emails. This may involve sharing 
                        information about you such as your email address with 
                        these organizations. By subscribing you

                        I will never sell your data to anyone or give it to anyone 
                        other than the third-party services described above. All that
